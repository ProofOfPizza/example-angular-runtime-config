# ExampleAngularRuntimeConfig

This is a small example project to show a minimalistic approach to changing runtime configs for angular apps.

It is further explained on my blog [calzone.ProofOfPizza](https://calzone.proofofpizza.com/tech/tutorial/Angular-environment-variables-at-runtime/).

Feel free to use is as you wish.
